**Panic Attack Analysis Dashboard: Visualizing Mental Health Trends**

**2. Short Description / Purpose**

This Power BI dashboard delivers an insightful analysis of panic attack patterns using real-time data sourced from Snowflake. It visualizes critical metrics such as frequency, duration, triggers, and symptoms, enabling users to interactively explore correlations between emotional states, time of day, and external stressors. The project showcases the integration of cloud-based data warehousing with business intelligence tools to support mental health awareness through data-driven insights.

**3. Tech Stack**

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
‚Ä¢ üìä Power BI Desktop ‚Äì Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
‚Ä¢ üìÇ Power Query ‚Äì Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
‚Ä¢ üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
‚Ä¢ üìÅ File Format ‚Äì .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

**4. Data Source**

The dataset on panic attacks was sourced from Snowflake, comprising self-reported data from individuals experiencing panic episodes. It includes detailed information on common **symptoms** (e.g., shortness of breath, chest pain), **triggers** (e.g., crowded spaces, stress), and **daily habits** (e.g., sleep patterns, caffeine intake) associated with panic attacks. This dataset helps identify patterns and potential correlations between lifestyle factors and panic attack frequency.

**5. Key Features of the Dashboard**

**Symptom Frequency Overview:**
Bar charts display how common key symptoms are (e.g., sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain, trembling). For example, sweating was the most reported symptom among patients.

**Lifestyle Insights:**

Line charts analyze patient distribution based on sleep hours and alcohol consumption per week.
Helps visualize potential lifestyle correlations with panic attack occurrences.

**Panic Attack Duration:**
A detailed area-line chart shows the number of patients versus the duration (in minutes) of their attacks, identifying trends in how long episodes typically last.

**Interactive Filtering:**

Users can segment data using slicers for:

Panic Score (High / Medium / Low)
Gender (Female, Male, Non-binary)
Trigger Type (Caffeine, PTSD, Social Anxiety, Phobia)
Medical History (Anxiety, Depression, None, PTSD)
